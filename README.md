### Short Bio

- 🎓 From September 2022, Haiyang started his Ph.D. degree in computer software and theory in [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/) of [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/).
- 🏅 Haiyang received his B.E degree from [School of Computer Science](https://jsj.nwpu.edu.cn/) in [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/) in June 2022.

- 🌱 My research interests lie in **agents based on large models (LLMs/MLMs)**. Specifically, I am interested in:
  - 🔗 **The integration of LMs with APIs (tools).**
  - 🛠 **The software engineering challenges associated with the integration.**
  - 📱 **The applications of LMs on edge devices.**
- 📚 My [**research group**](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1025/2713.htm) primarily focuses on system software, including *machine learning systems*, *serverless computing*, *web systems*, *software engineering*, and etc. In my first year of Ph.D., I studied anomaly detection, federated learning, inference optimization for LLMs in the cloud, etc.
- 🔍 Throughout my studies from system software to deep learning, I have gained knowledge in various areas including *methods and applications of natural language processing*, *retrieval systems*, *data analysis and mining*, *acceleration*, and *application of machine learning systems*.
